# Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic perhaps more than any other event in human history has demonstrated the critical importance that telecommunications infrastructure plays in keeping
businesses, governments, and societies connected and running. Because of the economic and
social disruption caused by the pandemic,millions of people being forced to stay home to
help stop the spread of COVID-19 and rely on video conferencing services for working from
home.However, one of the most critical weaknesses of these services is that they do not
eliminate background noise, which is a major problem in team meetings for users who live
in noisy areas, as their voice is not clear to other participants because of the noise.

#  Purpose of the project

The objective of the project is to implement a video conferencing application capable of
eliminating background noise and transcribing speech into text in real time.

# Home Page
As you can see this is the HomePage for my Application, the user will have two
options create a room or join a Public room. To create a room the user should enter a
name for the room and if the name is not used in another room a new room will be
created,in addition to that user have the choice to create a public or private room, for the
private room a password is required.
